<p>Casey Brezik, an accused anarchist assassin from the Kansas City area who is charged with slashing the throat of the Dean of Metropolitan Community College-Penn Valley in a plot to attack the Governor of Missouri, Jay Nixon during a talk at the college. (Nixon later canceled.) Casey is currently being held by the state of Missouri for 12 years on each of three counts – assault, and two armed criminal action charges – and seven years on a second count of assault. All sentences will run concurrently.</p>

<p>In February 2011, the state declared him to be incapable of standing trial, which means he was forced to stay locked up in a mental institution until June of 2013 when he was sentenced to 12 years in state prison and transferred to the diagnostic and reception prison in St Joseph MO. Casey is now in Jefferson City Correctional Center, which is about 9 miles from the state capitol building.

<p>In a letter dated Sept 15 2013, Casey lamented the lack of letters but learned it was a fact of prison life. “Everyone on the outside has things going on and may not be able to take the time out to communicate with us in here.”</p>

<p>Casey has requested letters and books. Casey is teaching himself Japanese and advanced calculus. He can only have a few books, so he wants to keep the ones he has. books, specific title requests make great gifts btw. </p>

<p>Casey closes his letter with a note on the controlled state of reading materials and its affects, saying, “there are several comrades in here that don’t have access to radical news sources.”</p>

<p>Casey Brezik is currently raising funds for college classes
Casey Brezik writes articles published by KCABC</p>
